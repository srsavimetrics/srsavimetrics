Mr. Manning is also considered an expert in the ecology and management of wildlife trees (i.e., dead and dying trees), including many of the animal species which utilize these valuable forest structural elements. He is a pioneer in the use of innovative fungal inoculation treatments to create wildlife trees as part of ecosystem enhancement and habitat restoration treatments. Todd has also worked on a variety of other wildlife species, ranging from grizzly bear to moose to forest songbirds and Marbled Murrelet, conducting habitat suitability assessments and modelling, species inventories, and habitat management planning and best practices development at multiple spatial scales.
