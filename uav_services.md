With its fleet of advanced UAVs, camera payloads and image rendering software, SRS can provide high quality imaging and mapping products for:

## Wildlife Monitoring and Assessments
* Ungulate winter range
* Old forest canopy structure
* Wetland health: riparian and near-shore aquatic vegetation, shoreline condition
* Waterfowl and shorebird inventory
* Large stick nest monitoring (e.g., Bald Eagle)

## Forest and Range Practices Monitoring
* Post-harvest cutblock assessments: wildlife tree retention patches, riparian management areas, coarse woody debris, erosion and site degradation
* Stream condition
  * Pool abundance, large woody debris, bank erosion, riparian vegetation, windthrow, fish passage barriers
* Terrain condition (e.g., evidence of slope failure, mass wasting)
* Rangeland condition (e.g., seasonal grazing levels)

## Wildfire Control
* Hot-spot detection and mapping

## Land Development and Construction Projects
* Quarries, strip and open pit mines, reservoirs
  * Photo-chronicling, 3D orthomosaics, digital surface models (DSM), aggregate volume calculations
* Linear corridor monitoring (hydro-electric transmission lines, pipelines) â€“ vegetation encroachment, spills
