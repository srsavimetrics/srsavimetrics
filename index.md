Our work includes:

* Species inventories
* Habitat suitability assessments
* Habitat management planning, guidance and mitigation strategies
* Habitat and ecosystem restoration



While our specialty is birds and their habitats, we have substantial expertise with the suite of species known as *"wildlife tree users"*, which include cavity nesting birds (such as woodpeckers and sapsuckers, and stick nesting raptors) and secondary cavity dwellers (such as owls, marten, fisher, black bears, and bats).

SRS also has Transport Canada certification for operation of *small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems* in British Columbia. This advanced technology can be used to efficiently acquire *site-specific photographic inventories* and develop *mapping products* for wildlife habitats and resource development footprint areas.
