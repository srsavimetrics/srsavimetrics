<span class="accent1">*“Developing practical solutions to natural resource management issues.”*</span>

SRS Avimetrics is an independently owned **natural resource and environmental consulting company**. SRS works extensively with *threatened and endangered terrestrial species* in *British Columbia and western North America*. Our work includes:

* Species inventories
* Habitat assessments
* Habitat management planning, guidance and mitigation strategies (e.g., recommended best practices at multiple spatial and temporal scales)
* Habitat and ecosystem restoration

While our specialty is birds and their habitats, we have substantial expertise with the suite of species known as *“wildlife tree users”*, including cavity nesting birds such as woodpeckers and sapsuckers, large stick nesting raptors, and secondary cavity dwellers such as small owls, marten, fisher, black bear and bats.

SRS also has Transport Canada certification for operation of *small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems* in British Columbia. This advanced technology can be used to efficiently acquire *site-specific photographic inventories* and develop *mapping products* for wildlife habitats and resource development footprint areas.

SRS is a **BC Forest Safety Council Safe Certified Company**.
