Our work includes:

* Species inventories, particularly various species at risk
* Habitat assessments
* Habitat management planning
* Developing recommended best management practices, prescriptions, and mitigation strategies for species and habitats at multiple spatial and temporal scales
* Habitat and ecosystem restoration
* Training and extension, including species inventories and hazard/danger tree assessment


We have substantial expertise with most native bird species in western Canada, and in particular various cavity nesting birds, large stick nesting raptors (e.g., Northern Goshawk, Bald Eagle), Marbled Murrelet, furbearers (e.g., marten, fisher), black bear and grizzly bear, moose and bats.

SRS has Transport Canada certification for operation of *small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems* in British Columbia. This advanced technology can be used to efficiently acquire *site-specific photographic inventories* and develop *mapping products* for wildlife habitats, wildfire management, and various resource development footprint areas.
