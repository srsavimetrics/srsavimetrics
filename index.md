<span class="accent1">*“Developing practical solutions to natural resource management issues.”*</span>

SRS Avimetrics is an independently owned **natural resource and environmental consulting company**. SRS works extensively with *threatened and endangered wildlife species* in *British Columbia and western North America*. Our work includes:

* Species inventories
* Habitat suitability assessments
* Habitat management planning, guidance and mitigation strategies
* Habitat and ecosystem restoration

While our specialty is birds and their habitats, we have substantial expertise with the suite of species known as *“wildlife tree users”*, which include cavity nesting birds (such as woodpeckers and sapsuckers, and stick nesting raptors) and secondary cavity dwellers (such as owls, marten, fisher, black bears, and bats).

SRS also has Transport Canada certification for operation of *small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems* in British Columbia. This advanced technology can be used to efficiently acquire *site-specific photographic inventories* and develop *mapping products* for wildlife habitats and resource development footprint areas.

SRS is a **[BC Forest Safety Council Safe Certified](http://www.bcforestsafe.org/safe_companies/registration.html) Company**.
